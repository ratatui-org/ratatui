/// unicode replacement characters (�) instead of braille dots. The Braille patterns provide a more
/// fine grained result (2x4 dots) but you might want to use a simple dot, block, or bar instead by
/// calling the [`marker`] method if your target environment does not support those symbols,
///
/// See [Unicode Braille Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_Patterns) for more info.
///
/// The `HalfBlock` marker is useful when you want to draw shapes with a higher resolution than a
/// `CharGrid` but lower than a `BrailleGrid`. This grid type supports a foreground and background
/// color for each terminal cell. This allows for more flexibility than the `BrailleGrid` which only
/// supports a single foreground color for each 2x4 dots cell.
///
/// The Canvas widget is used by calling the [`Canvas::paint`] method and passing a closure that
/// will be used to draw on the canvas. The closure will be passed a [`Context`] object that can be
/// used to draw shapes on the canvas.
///
/// The [`Context`] object provides a [`Context::draw`] method that can be used to draw shapes on
/// the canvas. The [`Context::layer`] method can be used to save the current state of the canvas
/// and start a new layer. This is useful if you want to draw multiple shapes on the canvas in
/// specific order. The [`Context`] object also provides a [`Context::print`] method that can be
/// used to print text on the canvas. Note that the text is always printed on top of the canvas and
/// is not affected by the layers.
