//! `widgets` is a collection of types that implement [`Widget`] or [`StatefulWidget`] or both.
//!
//! Widgets are created for each frame as they are consumed after rendered.
//! They are not meant to be stored but used as *commands* to draw common figures in the UI.
//!
//! The available widgets are:
//! - [`Block`]: a basic widget that draws a block with optional borders, titles and styles.
//! - [`BarChart`]: displays multiple datasets as bars with optional grouping.
//! - [`calendar::Monthly`]: displays a single month.
//! - [`Canvas`]: draws arbitrary shapes using drawing characters.
//! - [`Chart`]: displays multiple datasets as a lines or scatter graph.
//! - [`Clear`]: clears the area it occupies. Useful to render over previously drawn widgets.
//! - [`Gauge`]: displays progress percentage using block characters.
//! - [`LineGauge`]: display progress as a line.
//! - [`List`]: displays a list of items and allows selection.
//! - [`Paragraph`]: displays a paragraph of optionally styled and wrapped text.
//! - [`Scrollbar`]: displays a scrollbar.
//! - [`Sparkline`]: display a single data set as a sparkline.
//! - [`Table`]: displays multiple rows and columns in a grid and allows selection.
//! - [`Tabs`]: displays a tab bar and allows selection.
//!
//! [`Canvas`]: crate::widgets::canvas::Canvas

/// A `Widget` is a type that can be drawn on a [`Buffer`] in a given [`Rect`].
///
/// Prior to Ratatui 0.26.0, widgets generally were created for each frame as they were consumed
/// during rendering. This meant that they were not meant to be stored but used as *commands* to
/// draw common figures in the UI.
///
/// Starting with Ratatui 0.26.0, the `Widget` trait was more universally implemented on &T instead
/// of just T. This means that widgets can be stored and reused across frames. This allows widgets
/// to be stored in a struct and reused across frames by ref.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use ratatui::{backend::TestBackend, prelude::*, widgets::*};
///
/// # let backend = TestBackend::new(5, 5);
/// # let mut terminal = Terminal::new(backend).unwrap();
///
/// terminal.draw(|frame| {
///     // A widget can be rendered by simply calling its `render` method.
///     frame.render_widget(Clear, frame.size());
/// });
/// ```
pub trait Widget {
    /// Draws the current state of the widget in the given buffer. That is the only method required
    /// to implement a custom widget.
    fn render(self, area: Rect, buf: &mut Buffer);
}

/// A `StatefulWidget` is a widget that can take advantage of some local state to remember things
/// between two draw calls.
///
/// Most widgets can be drawn directly based on the input parameters. However, some features may
/// require some kind of associated state to be implemented.
///
/// For example, the [`List`] widget can highlight the item currently selected. This can be
/// translated in an offset, which is the number of elements to skip in order to have the selected
/// item within the viewport currently allocated to this widget. The widget can therefore only
/// provide the following behavior: whenever the selected item is out of the viewport scroll to a
/// predefined position (making the selected item the last viewable item or the one in the middle
/// for example). Nonetheless, if the widget has access to the last computed offset then it can
/// implement a natural scrolling experience where the last offset is reused until the selected
/// item is out of the viewport.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use std::io;
///
/// use ratatui::{backend::TestBackend, prelude::*, widgets::*};
///
/// // Let's say we have some events to display.
/// struct Events {
///     // `items` is the state managed by your application.
///     items: Vec<String>,
///     // `state` is the state that can be modified by the UI. It stores the index of the selected
///     // item as well as the offset computed during the previous draw call (used to implement
///     // natural scrolling).
///     state: ListState,
/// }
///
/// impl Events {
///     fn new(items: Vec<String>) -> Events {
///         Events {
///             items,
///             state: ListState::default(),
///         }
///     }
///
///     pub fn set_items(&mut self, items: Vec<String>) {
///         self.items = items;
///         // We reset the state as the associated items have changed. This effectively reset
///         // the selection as well as the stored offset.
///         self.state = ListState::default();
///     }
///
///     // Select the next item. This will not be reflected until the widget is drawn in the
///     // `Terminal::draw` callback using `Frame::render_stateful_widget`.
